# NFT Preview Card Component

Welcome to my implementation of the [NFT Preview Card Component challenge from Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U)! This project focuses on crafting a visually appealing card using only HTML and CSS. It's a simple yet effective way to practice front-end development skills, particularly in layout, styling, and responsiveness.

## Project Overview

The project features an NFT preview card, displaying an image of a digital art piece, a title, a description, and additional information about the price and the creator. The card is styled to have a modern and clean design, with a focus on typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The structure of the card is built using semantic HTML5 elements, ensuring accessibility and good SEO practices.
- **CSS:** All styling is accomplished with pure CSS, including layout, typography, colors, and hover effects. No additional frameworks or libraries are used.
